# Voice Assistant
A Python script that builds an intelligent voice assistant.

The assistant is capable of:
  ▪️ Saying hello;
  ▪️ Creating notes in a txt file;
  ▪️ Adding items to a shopping list and showing them;
  ▪️ Opening specific tabs on YouTube or Google;
  ▪️ Getting the daily news headlines;
  ▪️ Getting the holidays that will be celebrated in the current year.

All of this is possible through the use of speech recognition, text-to-speech and web scraping.
